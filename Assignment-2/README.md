# Software Construction – Code Review & AI Support

## Question 3: Why version control is critical in team based software development
Modern software is rarely built by one person therefore developers need professional tools such as Github, to work on the same project. Here's why version control is critical; 
- Enables teamwork: Version control lets multiple developers work on the same project, track changes over time, and maintain accountability and quality.  
- Provides full history and traceability: A repository stores the code, documentation, and the entire history of changes, acting like a shared project notebook.  ￼
- Supports safe workflows: Developers work in isolated spaces (branches), record changes, and merge only after review, which helps avoid conflicts and maintain stability.  ￼
- Improves quality and reduces errors: Projects become traceable, reviewable, and improvable, which reduces mistakes and improves teamwork.

## Question 4: Importance of Code Reviews

Code reviews help improve software quality and developer skills by allowing team members to examine code before it is merged.

### Benefits
- Detect bugs and security issues early
- Enforce coding standards and consistency
- Improve code readability and maintainability
- Encourage knowledge sharing within the team
- Help developers learn through constructive feedback

Code reviews lead to reliable software and stronger development teams.

## Question 5: Role of AI in Understanding Code

AI tools assist developers in understanding and working with code but do not replace learning.

### How AI Helps
- Explains complex code and logic
- Assists with debugging and error detection
- Provides examples and learning support
- Improves productivity

### Why Learning Is Still Required
- Developers must understand concepts, not just results
- Critical thinking and problem-solving are human skills
- AI may lack full project context

AI is a support tool, while learning and practice build real expertise.
