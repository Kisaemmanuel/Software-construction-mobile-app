# Software Construction – Code Review & AI Support
## Question 1: Difference between programming and software construction (with a real-world example)

Programming is the act of writing code so that a computer performs a specific task.  
It focuses mainly on making the code work.

Software construction is much broader. It includes writing code, but also thinking about how the software is designed, organized, tested, documented, maintained, and improved over time by a team. It focuses on making the software reliable, changeable, and understandable for others.

### Real-world example: Building a house

Programming is like laying bricks to build a wall.  
You are doing the physical work that makes the structure stand.

Software construction is like planning the house, drawing the blueprint, choosing materials, organizing workers, ensuring plumbing and electricity work together, and making sure the house can be renovated later.

A person laying bricks may build a wall that stands today.  
But without a plan, the house may be:

- Hard to modify
- Unsafe
- Difficult for others to continue building

### Apply this to software

A programmer may write code that works today.  
A software constructor writes code that:

- Other team members can understand
- Can be easily changed in the future
- Is tested and documented
- Fits into a larger system design

## Question 3: Why version control is critical in team based software development
Modern software is rarely built by one person therefore developers need professional tools such as Github, to work on the same project. Here's why version control is critical; 
- Enables teamwork: Version control lets multiple developers work on the same project, track changes over time, and maintain accountability and quality.  
- Provides full history and traceability: A repository stores the code, documentation, and the entire history of changes, acting like a shared project notebook.  ￼
- Supports safe workflows: Developers work in isolated spaces (branches), record changes, and merge only after review, which helps avoid conflicts and maintain stability.  ￼
- Improves quality and reduces errors: Projects become traceable, reviewable, and improvable, which reduces mistakes and improves teamwork.

## Question 4: Importance of Code Reviews

Code reviews help improve software quality and developer skills by allowing team members to examine code before it is merged.

### Benefits
- Detect bugs and security issues early
- Enforce coding standards and consistency
- Improve code readability and maintainability
- Encourage knowledge sharing within the team
- Help developers learn through constructive feedback

Code reviews lead to reliable software and stronger development teams.

## Question 5: Role of AI in Understanding Code

AI tools assist developers in understanding and working with code but do not replace learning.

### How AI Helps
- Explains complex code and logic
- Assists with debugging and error detection
- Provides examples and learning support
- Improves productivity

### Why Learning Is Still Required
- Developers must understand concepts, not just results
- Critical thinking and problem-solving are human skills
- AI may lack full project context

AI is a support tool, while learning and practice build real expertise.
