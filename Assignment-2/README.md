## Question 5: Role of AI in Understanding Code

AI tools assist developers in understanding and working with code but do not replace learning.

### How AI Helps
- Explains complex code and logic
- Assists with debugging and error detection
- Provides examples and learning support
- Improves productivity

### Why Learning Is Still Required
- Developers must understand concepts, not just results
- Critical thinking and problem-solving are human skills
- AI may lack full project context

AI is a support tool, while learning and practice build real expertise.
